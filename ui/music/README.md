# Music Cover Videos

Music cover videos are a popular format on YouTube, where the visual content consists solely of a single static image of
the song or album cover. This static image is shown while the audio track plays throughout the video. 

They're easy to create, making it accessible for artists to upload and share music without the need of heavy video 
editing skills. They're effective for focusing the listener's attention on the music itself, as well as a way to promote 
the song or album visually through the chosen artwork, adding a layer of branding or artistic expression to the song.
